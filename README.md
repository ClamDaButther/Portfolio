# Zelda Remake
(These are the scripts I worked on)

Aim: This script will make your camera fixate at the target(target is given in an other script)

ArrowHit: This script destroy's the target(object).

BossEyeHealth: This script gives the boss his health (His 2 eyes that can be dammaged and destroyed)

BossSlam: This script will make the boss his hand/s come down to do dammage.

FBmvm: This the boss sends a "fireball" at the player his last position and destroys it after 0.7 sec.

FireBalls: This script calls "FBmvm" to send multiple fireballs at the player (with a cooldown time between calls).

ProjectileAddForce: This script gives the arrow his speed and drop after his release, it also checks if the arrow
                    hits the target and needs to be destroyed.

Shoot: This script creates a shootable arrow in the bow and counts how many arrows it can shoot until it runs out.

UIBars: This script gives you Black bars in the screen (top and bottom) when the player is focused (aimed) on the target.
