# Dungeon Slime
(These are the scripts I worked on)

CameraFollow: This script will make the camera follow the player smoothly on a set position with.

CreateRandom: This script chooses a random terrain object (you already have created) and sets it on
              the object this script is on (and destorys the object afterwards).
              
PlayerMove: This script gives you the controls to walk and jump, and it changes the camera & walkposition
            at the specified positions.
